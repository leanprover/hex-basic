@[expose] public section

/-!
Reusable operations missing from `Std.ExtTreeMap`.

The declarations stay in the `Std.ExtTreeMap` namespace and use only standard
library types so they can be proposed upstream independently of Hex.
When one lands upstream, delete the copy here in the same commit that updates
the toolchain: unlike theorem shims, duplicate definitions cannot coexist
across imported modules even when their signatures agree.

`mergeWith?` is the deletion-capable analogue of `mergeWith`. It folds the
smaller tree into the larger one, preserving the argument order seen by the
collision function. `foldl₂` performs one ordered traversal of both maps and
reports left-only, shared, and right-only keys without repeated lookup.

representative. The implementation performs linear merge work after
materializing the two ordered streams. -/

/-- Merge two maps, allowing a collision to delete its key.

Left-only and right-only entries are retained unchanged. The smaller map is
folded into the larger map, so the operation performs
`O(min(m,n) * log(max(m,n)))` tree work. The collision callback always receives
the left value before the right value, independent of which map is smaller.
`LawfulEqCmp` makes comparator-equivalent keys propositionally equal, so the
choice of the larger map cannot observably change the stored collision key. -/
