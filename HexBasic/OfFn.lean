Kernel-reducible function tabulation for {name}`Array` and {name}`Vector`.

{name}`Array.ofFn` delegates to its `ofFn.go` auxiliary, which is not exposed, so
under the module system its body is unavailable downstream and
`(Array.ofFn f)` does not reduce in the kernel. {name}`Vector.ofFn` is itself
`@[expose]` but calls {name}`Array.ofFn`, so it inherits the stall.

{name}`List.ofFn` is fully exposed and reduces, so the definitions below go through
it. That is the wrong shape for compiled code, which wants to push into an
array of known capacity rather than build a linked list and convert, so each
carries a `@[csimp]` lemma redirecting the compiler back to the core version.
The {name}`List` route is then paid only in the kernel, which is where it is
needed.

/-! # Compatibility lemmas

Core's lemmas ({name}`Array.size_ofFn`, {name}`Vector.getElem_ofFn`, …) are
stated about {name}`Array.ofFn` and {name}`Vector.ofFn` and do not apply
directly to {name}`Hex.Array.ofFn'` or {name}`Hex.Vector.ofFn'`.
{name}`Hex.Array.ofFn'_eq_ofFn` is `@[simp]`, so ordinary `simp` bridges the
gap; these lemmas also support `simp only` proofs and `rfl`-closing steps. -/
